# Official paper experiments

This directory contains the two studies used in the SISC submission: Module 04
online autotuning and accepted Module 05 matched-hierarchy Run 05.

| Study | Entry point | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Module 04: Default, LinUCB, and LinUCB–LSTDQ over 5000 problems | `python -m experiments.paper_final.run_04_online` | [Frozen design](04_online/20260920_formal/README.md), [captured six-seed configurations](reproduction/online/six_seeds.json) |
| Module 05: frozen policies on matched hierarchies | `python -m experiments.paper_final.run_05_policy_minimax` | [Accepted Run 05](05_policy/RUN05.md), [captured protocol](reproduction/matched_policy/protocol.json) |

Start with the [reproduction guide](../../docs/reproduction.md) for commands,
required external artifacts, environment setup, and timing definitions.
The [reproduction manifest](reproduction/manifest.json) preserves the hashes of
captured configurations and compact accepted evidence.

`common/` contains internal helpers for durable artifact I/O, frozen evaluation,
matched cost aggregation, worker supervision, and figure presentation. Numerical
solver and learner implementations remain in their own packages.

Only the two official studies and their supporting helpers are included in this
submission tree. Captured measurements, source snapshots, and checkpoint formats
retain their recorded provenance.
